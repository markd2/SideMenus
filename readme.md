Side Menus
==========

This is a demo program referred to in the Big Nerd Ranch blog posting
[Experimentally Yours](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1722-experimentally-yours/)

A little project to see how menus around the side of the iPad might work.  You
can pick up your device and see how it feels to use your thumb to trigger menu
items while doing other stuff with the app.
